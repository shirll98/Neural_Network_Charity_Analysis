# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview 
In this project, machine learning and neural networks were used to analyze  organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. 

## Results 
### Data Processing 
In the data processing step, I used the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL" variable as the main targe for the model. While using the rest of the variables were used as features of the model. I also dropped the EIN and NAME columns from the input data. 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the model 
Upon compiling, training, and evaluating the model, the parameters were still unable to achieve the target model performance which is above 75%.i tried to change the hidden node layers as well as removing irrevalent variables inside the input data, or neurons per layer but the target performance was still not achievable.  

## Summary 
Although the pre-processing dataset, compiling and regression of network model was succesful but the model performance did not achieve the desired 75%. I think this could be due to the potential lack of variables in the dataset. It is very possible that the dataset needs more variables than that is provided.
